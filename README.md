# Retail Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive retail analytics dashboard designed to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders by visualizing sales, customer, and product data. It helps monitor business performance, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making. The dashboard was built using Power BI and leverages Python and SQL for data preprocessing and analysis.

## Use Case

In a retail environment, decision-makers often need clear answers to questions such as:

- Which products are performing well or poorly?
- How are different regions contributing to total revenue?
- What patterns can be identified in customer behavior?

This dashboard provides a visual and interactive way to answer these questions and improve strategic decisions.

## Features

- Sales trend analysis by month and quarter
- Regional performance breakdown
- Customer segmentation by demographics and purchase history
- Product category performance analysis
- KPI tracking for revenue, profit margin, and units sold
- Geo-mapping of sales across locations

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Power BI | Dashboard creation, DAX for KPI calculations, interactive visuals |
| Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) | Data cleaning, exploratory analysis |
| SQL | Data querying, transformations (joins, aggregates, filtering) |
| Excel | Supplementary modeling and preprocessing support |


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) inside the `/reports` folder
3. Load the sample dataset from `/data`
4. Explore the dashboard and use filters/slicers for insights

For optional preprocessing and data analysis, refer to the Jupyter notebooks in `/notebooks`.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with live sales data APIs for real-time insights
- Advanced forecasting models using time series techniques
- Automated customer segmentation using clustering algorithms

## Key Learnings

- Applied data cleaning and transformation using SQL and Python
- Developed multiple KPIs using DAX in Power BI
- Improved dashboard storytelling through layout and interactivity
- Strengthened understanding of sales metrics and retail business logic
